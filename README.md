### Introduction

This repository contains tools designed to help network operations staff save and restore the configuration from their F5 Distributed Cloud tenant. These tools are scripts to be run on a Linux server to create a backup file of the configuration settings (backup function) or to apply those settings to a system (restore function).

### Contents

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
[Installation](#installation)
[Usage](#usage)
[Example Output](#example-output)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following configuration objects are supported for backup and restore functions only:

> - HTTP Load Balancer
> - TCP Load Balancer
> - Origin Servers and Pools
> - Health Check
> - App Firewalls with it WAF exclusion policy
> - API Definition
> - Service Policy
> - Rate Limiter Policy
> - Malicious User Policy
> - User Identification Policy
> - IP Prefix Set
> - Forward Proxy Policy
> - Alert Policy
> - Alert Receiver
> - Global Log Receiver
> - Certificate Management
> - Certificate Management Chain
> - Service Discovery

### Prerequisites

Before using these tools, you need to have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: This is the programming language in which the script is written. You need to have it installed on your system to run the script.
- **F5XC Tenant URL**: This is the web address of your specific network management area.
- **F5XC API Token**: This is a special code that allows the script to access and modify your network settings. You can obtain an API Token by following the instructions provided in the F5 documentation [here](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/user-mgmt/credentials).
- **Namespace**: Before running the restore function, make sure the namespace (a specific area within your tenant where settings are applied) exists.

### Installation

Refer to [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

### Usage
